A potfolio of the projects I have completed during my MSci in Theoretical Physics at Imperial College London.

Each folder contains a README text file, the code and results for the project, and the accompanying project report. 

Here is a brief overview and the aims of each project: 

1) Complexity Science: 
> Simulate a sandpile using the Oslo Model and investigate its complex statistical behaviours. 
> This shows experience with OOP in building a physical simulation, and creativity in increasing efficiency by treating it as a branching process. 
> Also data visualisation and pickling simulations and data structures.

2) Computational Assignment:
> Code up several key fundamental algorithms, including: Crout matrix solver, cubic interpolator, and RNG for a general distribution. 
> This demonstrates an ability to transfer a general mathematical algorithm to written code. 

3) Computational Project:
> Develop and compare minimsation functions. Therse were used to minimise a cost function, as is typically done in ML. 
> The algorithms developed included: univariate minimiser, gradient descent, and quasi-Newton descent.

4) Thermodynamics Project: 
> Simulate an ideal gas as a collection of hard spheres undergoing inelastic collisions. 
> This was a large OOP project involving developing a simulation and probes to analyse the thermodynamic behaviours of the system.
