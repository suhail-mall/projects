A potfolio of the projects I have completed during my MSci in Theoretical Physics at Imperial College London.

Each folder contains a README text file, the code and results for the project, and the accompanying project report. 

Here is a brief overview and the aims of each project: 

1) Computational Assignment:
> A project to code up several key fundamental algorithms, including: Crout matrix solver, cubic interpolator, and RNG for a general distribution. 
> This demonstrates an ability to transfer a general mathematical algorithm to written code. 

2) Computational Project:
> A project to develop and compare minimsation functions. Therse were used to minimise a cost function, as is typically done in Machine Learning projects. 
> The algorithms developed included: univariate minimiser, gradient descent, and quasi-Newton descent.

3) Thermodynamics Project: 
> A project to simulate an ideal gas as a collection of hard spheres undergoing inelastic collisions. 
> This was a large OOP project involving developing a simulation and probes to analyse the thermodynamic behaviours of the system.
