A potfolio of the projects I have completed during my MSci master's course in Theoretical Physics at Imperial College London.
Each folder contains a README text file, the code and results for the project, and the accompanying project report. 
Here is a brief overview and the aims of each project: 

#### **Computational Assignment**: ####

* A project to code up several key fundamental algorithms, including: Crout matrix solver, cubic interpolator, and RNG for a general distribution. 
* This demonstrates an ability to transfer a general mathematical algorithm to written code. 

#### **Computational Project:** ####

* A project to develop and compare minimsation functions. 
* These were used to minimise a cost function, as is typically done in Machine Learning projects. 
* The algorithms developed included: univariate minimiser, gradient descent, and quasi-Newton descent.

#### **Thermodynamics Project:** ####

* A project to simulate an ideal gas as a collection of hard spheres undergoing inelastic collisions. 
* This was a large OOP project involving developing a simulation and probes to analyse the thermodynamic behaviours of the system. 

#### **Complexity Project:** ####
* A project to simulate a pile of sand using hte Oslo Model. 
* Used OOP to build model.
* Increased efficiency of process by treating it as a branching process rather than brute-forcing.
* Analysed complex behaviours and statistics of system.
